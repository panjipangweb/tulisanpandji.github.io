Imagine a breathtaking collaboration between Icelandic musician Ólafur Arnalds and the innovative Cercle collective. They recently treated the world to an extraordinary live performance in Iceland's untamed wilderness. It was Cercle's first time in Iceland, and they chose a spot with no internet connection. Sounds unbelievable, right? Well, you can watch this incredible performance on Cercle's YouTube channel.

The show was a fantastic mix of different kinds of music. Ólafur Arnalds surprised everyone by playing more upbeat songs than usual because of Cercle's influence. These songs were rearranged to mix acoustic sounds (think string quartet) with electronic beats, creating a unique blend of music. This cool idea showed how well Ólafur Arnalds and Cercle work together.

Now, let's learn more about Ólafur Arnalds. He's an Icelandic musician who has won over people's hearts worldwide. He was born in 1986 in a town near Reykjavík, Iceland's capital. Music has been his passion since he was little, and there's even a touching short film about his life called "When We Are Born" (2021). In the film, you can see him as a child playing the drums and having his first concert in his parents' garage.

But here's the twist: Ólafur Arnalds didn't start as a composer. He was a drummer for a hardcore punk/thrash metal band in Iceland. However, things changed when he shared some piano and string demos with a German metal band called Heaven Shall Burn. They liked his work so much that they asked him to create intros and outros for their 2004 album "Antigone," and the first track, "Echoes," turned out great.

You might think that's unusual, but it gets even more interesting. Ólafur Arnalds released his first solo album in 2007 called "Eulogy For Evolution." It's quite diverse, with dreamy sounds, rock elements, and even a touch of thrash metal at the end.

His music evolved, and by 2009, with the album "Found Songs," he was exploring different styles. He was inspired by Erik Satie and Edvard Grieg for some tracks, creating a unique sound with overlapping strings. He also tried something cool: he composed and recorded a song every day for a week, sharing them online right away.

In 2011, he took his music to his living room for "Living Room Songs." The goal was to capture the cozy feeling of his home. The songs, like "Fyrsta" ("First") and "Tomorrow's Song," were simple but beautifully recorded. You can still hear the sounds of his piano's pedals creaking.

Arnalds has a special way of playing the piano. He uses felt material to soften the strings, giving his music a unique touch. This technique, along with creative mic placement, makes his piano sound like it's speaking and breathing with the music. He's been using this approach in recent work like "Saman" on "Re:member" (2018).

In 2013, Arnalds released "For Now I Am Winter," which featured the captivating vocals of pop singer Arnór Dan and grand string arrangements. It was a big step forward, but he didn't forget his intimate style, as heard in "Words of Amber."

Ólafur Arnalds, the unassuming Icelander, has become a musical sensation. From a thrash metal drummer to a renowned composer, his unique journey is a testament to his endless creativity. With every composition, he continues to enchant audiences worldwide, leaving an indelible mark on the music world.
