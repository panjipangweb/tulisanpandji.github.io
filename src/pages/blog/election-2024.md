The 2024 Election in Indonesia caught the nation's attention with the emergence of three candidate pairs ready to compete. Anies Baswedan-Muhaimin Iskandar, Ganjar Pranowo-Mahfud MD, and Prabowo Subianto-Gibran Rakabuming Raka have been officially designated by the General Election Commission (KPU). Various surveys suggest a narrative that the 2024 Presidential Election may only take place in a single round, with the Prabowo-Gibran pair having the highest potential.

According to the one-round simulation results from the Populi Center, the electability of Prabowo-Gibran reaches 42.5 percent, surpassing the pairs of Ganjar-Mahfud (21.9 percent) and Anies-Cak Imin (18.4 percent). Similar results are also revealed by the Poltracking Indonesia survey, stating that Prabowo-Gibran has the potential to win in a single round if electability reaches 45 percent.

However, political experts hold different opinions. According to Idil Akbar, a lecturer in Political Science at Padjadjaran University, the survey results have not shown any candidate pair capable of achieving a simple majority, which is 50 percent. Idil finds it challenging to ascertain that the 2024 Presidential Election will only take place in one round, considering the dynamic political situation.

Certainly, there is skepticism from some quarters, including some political experts and political science professors. However, as a dumb person who understands nothing about politics, we must understand that in politics, nothing is certain. Today's survey results do not always reflect the reality of tomorrow's elections. The public has the ability to change their views and choices over time.

While various narratives unfold, and survey results take the spotlight, Anies Baswedan from the Coalition of Change remains confident in victory in a single round. He expresses his belief that the public must actively engage in overseeing the election process to ensure integrity and justice.

Of course, the final decision lies in the hands of the people. We as citizens have a crucial role in determining the direction of this nation. Therefore, it is important to continue to observe, question, and sift through information wisely. With a critical mindset and deep understanding, we can ensure that the 2024 Presidential Election takes place fairly, transparently, and in line with the spirit of democracy that we hold dear.
